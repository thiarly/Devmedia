        <h2>Luca e Alberto</h2>
        <p>Luca heads to Albertoâ€™s hiding place in an effort to reconcile with him and learns that he was abandoned by his father long ago. Though Alberto declines to participate in the triathlon,
             Luca promises to win the Vespa to rebuild their friendship. The triathlon begins with Luca and Giulia competing separately. Luca successfully completes the swimming race and pasta-eating contest without revealing himself, but rain begins during the bike race. Alberto shows up to give him an umbrella, but Ercole knocks him to the wet ground, exposing his sea monster form, much to everyone's horror. Luca this time helps him, albeit revealing himself as well.</p>
